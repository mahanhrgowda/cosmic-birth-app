# Cosmic Birth Explorer

## Overview
This Streamlit app takes a name, birth date, time, and time zone as input and generates fun, mind-titillating outputs based on the triple helix model, block universe theory, and the mantra "Om Śrīṁ Bhūṁ Nīlāṁ Agni-Nābhiṁ Prabodhaya Svāhā". It maps the birth to divine energies (Śrī, Bhū, Nīlā) and string theory types (open, closed, heterotic), providing cosmic Z-values, dominant qualities, and a simple spacetime wave visualization, with emojis and effects like balloons for fun!

## Features
- Input name, birth date, time, and time zone.
- Converts to UTC for cosmic consistency.
- Calculates Z-value, dominant energy, string type, and mantra linkage.
- Displays fun facts with emojis and a simple wave plot.
- Uses Streamlit's balloons for celebration!

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by spiritual yantra, block universe, triple helix model, and string theory.
- Mantra linkage: "Om Śrīṁ Bhūṁ Nīlāṁ Agni-Nābhiṁ Prabodhaya Svāhā" invokes fiery energy, mapping Śrīṁ to open strings (prosperity), Bhūṁ to closed strings (grounding), Nīlāṁ to heterotic strings (compassion).
